  <h3>About Me</h3>

  <p>After moving here to the United States in 2018, I changed my majors a few times. From being a Nursing student to MRI technology to Pharmacy Technician and now I am here studying Software Engineering. I tried copy-pasting codes for my Tumblr blog when I was younger and I did not realize until now that I enjoyed it. It might not be considered coding before but I learned how to put music on my blog, how to customize it, and add whatever I want in the code. </p>

  <p> I have a passion for web developing because I want to showcase my skills and what I can do to make the client's website function well and look aesthetically pleasing </p>

  <p>On the days i dont study, I usually just watch videos about Finance(investing, trading, multiple streams of income) because I want to broaden my knowledge and I believe in work smarter not harder.   </p>
